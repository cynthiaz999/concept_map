        "Humans are argumentative beings, and the ability to defend oneself in an argument has been important since classical times. Aristotle defined a rhetorician as someone who is always able to see what is persuasive (Topics VI.12, 149b25), and rhetoric as the ability to see what is persuasive in any situation (Rhet. I.2, 1355b26-27.). In other words, rhetoric is the art of persuasion. Today, rhetoric is still of high importance. We need to defend ourselves argumentatively far more often than we need physically. It feels bad losing an argument, but it feels even worse when losing an argument not because not knowing what to say, but rather how to say it.\n",
        "It is important to clarify that stressing the importance of rhetoric is not the same as arguing the “what to say” is of less importance than the “how”. It is not the case that rhetoric is used for those whose sole purpose is to “win the argument” by employing tricks. Rhetoric is needed, according to Aristotle, even when we are trying to be as truthful and straightforward as possible (Rhet. I.1, 1355a24–29). Suppose in situations when we need to deliver a complex argument in a field or topic the audiences greatly unfamiliar with. To defend our position, it is critical to lay out our argument as clear as possible. Rhetoric is thus related not just to persuade but also to be clear. The two concepts are nevertheless, linked: a clear argument is usually more persuasive than a confusing one.\n",
        "It is plausible that rhetorical ability is determined through using rhetorical devices. What makes a speech or an article more convincing? Is persuasiveness a random luck or is there any underlying commonalities? In Aristotle’s Rhetoric, there are three means of persuasion: ethos - persuasion through the credibility of the speaker; pathos – persuasion through the emotions of the audience; logos - persuasion through the logic of the argument (Rhet. I.2). This study will define pathos, logos as rhetorical devices with more detail and work with them in the respective analysis.\n",
        "Scientific articles are arguments in written forms. Papers have claims and they defend the claims through rhetorical devices. In the field of the study of the rhetoric of science, there are mainly two approaches. The “contextual” approach is “a historical and sociological focus on people, events, trends, movements, group practices, and cultural context”, and the “textual” approach is “a humanist focus on texts of all kinds, oral and written, involving close attention to language and to structures in discourse that only come into view with methods of analysis established in rhetorical theory” (Fahnestock, 2009, p.177). Despite this general distinction the methods of studying the rhetoric of science vary greatly. For example, one approach could be conduct analysis with only one article and with different methods in each chapter. (Selzer, 1993). Gross (1990) started with a review of traditional rhetorical constructs and applied them to different works in the subsequent chapters. Whereas Gross et al. (2002) sampled hundreds of articles across four languages and across four centuries, it focused on the change of style, argument, presentation and other features across languages and time. In this study, we have included two hundred published scientific papers from 2015 to 2016, but instead of using traditional rhetorical construct or focusing on the larger social aspects, our approach highlights defining rhetorical devices from the basics of Aristotle’s “means of persuasion” and the use of Large Language Model (LLM) for data collection.\n",
